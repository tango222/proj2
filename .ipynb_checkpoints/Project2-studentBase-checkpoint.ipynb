    "This tutorial walks through simply querying in MIMIC using Jupyter Notebook as the primary database interface instead of pgadmin4.  This was done to smooth the process of data processing and machine learning exercises, so that we wouldn't have to separately log in, query MIMIC in pgadmin4, download each query as a CSV, and subsequently upload CSV files into panda dataframes.  The tutorial assumes some prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You should have already installed Python via Anachonda.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You should already have postgreSQL 10.6, 11.1 downloaded.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3) You should be connected to the remote database through the ssh tunnel in git bash.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4) You should have installed pandas for data management purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) You should have installed numpy for statistical programming requirements.\n",
