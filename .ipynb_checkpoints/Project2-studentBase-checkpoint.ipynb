    "This tutorial walks through simply querying in MIMIC using Jupyter Notebook as the primary database interface instead of pgadmin4.  This was done to smooth the process of data processing and machine learning exercises, so that we wouldn't have to separately log in, query MIMIC in pgadmin4, download each query as a CSV, and subsequently upload CSV files into panda dataframes.  The tutorial assumes some prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You should have already installed Python via Anachonda.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You should already have postgreSQL 10.6, 11.1 downloaded.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3) You should be connected to the remote database through the ssh tunnel in git bash.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4) You should have installed pandas for data management purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) You should have installed numpy for statistical programming requirements.\n",

    "The paper aims to utilize big data analytics for Parkinson’s disease, where it is collected and managed by Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Previous studies have examined the relationship of the disease and risk to trauma, genetics, environment, or lifestyle, and Prof. Draganski’s team have integrated complex PPMI imaging, genetics, and clinical/demographic data. The paper emphasizes the collection of data of multiple sources to encompass the defining characteristics of Big Data, which include large size, incongruency, incompleteness, complexity, multiplicity of scales, and heterogeneity of data. Data characterization in this paper is uniquely spread into 3 main concepts: introduction of new methods for rebalancing data, use of wide classification methods for consistent phenotype predictions, and generate reproducible machine-learning classification that can incorporate new data as well as application for other neurodegenerative disorders. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Mimic database contains highly specific data to the ICU, a lot of the data necessary to pursue the analytics described in the paper is not available. In the paper there was exploratory analysis done on gender and their implications on past studies on parkinson's. The analysis from the paper proved that gender had negligible implications on getting Parkinson's. Using the mimic database, we queried the distribution of gender amongst admitted parkison's patients, and we analyzed the death rate of parkison's patients in male and female patients. Although a more interesting query could be made with the age of the patients, because of the complicance to HIPPA, the age for many of the patients is altered for the sake of patient privacy. Due to this, analysis based on age would prove to be very difficult, especially since the population of patients with Parkinson's would be around the 89 year age which is in the age range of many parkison's patients given that Parkison's is a disease that affects 1 in every 100 people over 60 years of age and parkison's patients have a lifespan of around 10-20 years after diagnosis. We figured that the variable 'expire_flag' would serve as a makeshift variable that could be indicative of age, operating under the assumption that most parkison's patients die when they are more senior without factoring in the possibilities of early onset Parkinson's, and other reason's for death.
